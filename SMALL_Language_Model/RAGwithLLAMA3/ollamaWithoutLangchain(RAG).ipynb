      "\n",
      "1. **Largest Land Animal**: Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, with African elephants weighing up to 6 tons (12,000 lbs) and Asian elephants weighing up to 5 tons (10,000 lbs).\n",
      "2. **Longest Lifespan**: Elephants have one of the longest lifespans in the animal kingdom, with a average lifespan of 50-70 years in the wild and up to 80 years in captivity.\n",
      "3. **Intelligent Brains**: Elephants have massive brains, with some weighing around 5 kg (11 lbs), which is larger than that of humans. They are known for their exceptional memory, problem-solving skills, and social intelligence.\n",
      "4. **Social Structure**: Elephants live in complex societies with a strict hierarchy, led by matriarchal herds. These herds are typically made up of related females, their offspring, and sometimes male relatives.\n",
      "5. **Communication**: Elephants communicate through a wide range of sounds, including rumbles, roars, trumpets, and even low-frequency vibrations that can be felt through the ground!\n",
      "6. **Trunks**: Elephants use their trunks for almost everything: eating, drinking, breathing, grasping objects, and even greeting each other.\n",
      "7. **Tusks**: Elephant tusks are actually elongated incisors made of ivory. They use these tusks to defend themselves, dig up food, and display social status.\n",
      "8. **Heritage**: Elephants have a strong sense of family and cultural heritage. They can recognize their own kin and even remember where they were born after decades of separation!\n",
      "9. **Conservation Status**: Unfortunately, elephants are threatened by poaching for ivory, habitat loss, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these magnificent creatures.\n",
      "10. **Symbolism**: Elephants have been revered across cultures for their wisdom, strength, and gentle nature. They symbolize good luck, longevity, and fertility in many Asian traditions.\n",
