Please enter the job role for negotiation (e.g., office_boy, software_engineer, senior_software_engineer, ai_engineer, ml_engineer): ml_engineer
Your starting offer is 90000
Health Insurance: False
Retirement Plan: False
Vacation Days: 10
Signing Bonus: 0
Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement) is 85000
Let's begin the negotiation. Type your statements or offers.


Your move: I like your starting offer of 90000 in my opinion it is less than what market is offering to ML engineer. I would like a offer of 100k along with free health insuranc
e, paid vacations and signing bonus.

HR: I understand your concerns regarding the starting offer of $90,000. However, I'd like to propose an alternative solution that still meets your expectations while considering our company's budget.

While we can't quite match your desired salary of $100,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97,500. This is a significant increase from the original offer and reflects our confidence in your skills as a ML engineer.

Regarding your request for free health insurance, I'd like to offer a comprehensive health insurance plan that covers 80% of medical expenses. While it's not entirely "free," this plan is one of the best in the industry and will provide you with peace of mind knowing you're well-covered.

As for paid vacations, we're already offering 10 days off, which is above the industry standard. However, I can consider adding an extra day or two to your vacation package if you'd like.

Regarding the signing bonus, I'm willing to offer a modest $3,000 signing bonus, which is still within our budget constraints.

What do you think about this revised offer? Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or negotiate further?


Your move: I will consider your offer if you will increase the bonnus to 5000 and as you said adding a extra two days to vacations so total vacatio will come to be 12

HR: I'm glad you're willing to consider our revised offer. I understand your request for an increase in the signing bonus and additional vacation days.

Regarding the signing bonus, I can see that $5,000 is a bit of a stretch for us, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $4,250. This is still a generous offer considering our company's budget constraints.

As for the vacation days, I'm happy to add two more days to your package, making it a total of 12 days off. However, I do want to mention that we have a unique work environment where we encourage collaboration and teamwork. Occasionally, this may require you to work on weekends or evenings to meet project deadlines.

I'd like to propose an alternative solution to the signing bonus. Instead of a lump sum payment, how about we offer a professional development fund of $2,000? This can be used for courses, certifications, or conferences that will help you grow professionally and stay up-to-date with industry trends.

What do you think about this revised proposal? Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or negotiate further?


Your move: I accept your offer
