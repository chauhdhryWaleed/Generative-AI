        Evaluate the following negotiation based on the chat log:

        Please provide feedback focusing solely on the candidate's contributions. For each of the following criteria, score out of 10 and provide a qualitative evaluation (Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced) against each of the evaluation metrics below. Here are some guidelines and examples to help you with the qualitative evaluation:

        1. **Effectiveness of the candidate's tactics**: 
        - **Beginner**: The candidate shows basic understanding of negotiation tactics but fails to apply them effectively.
        - **Intermediate**: The candidate applies some effective tactics and demonstrates a good understanding, but there is room for improvement.
        - **Advanced**: The candidate uses advanced tactics effectively and strategically, showing a deep understanding of negotiation principles.

        2. **Communication clarity**:
        - **Beginner**: The candidate's communication is often unclear or confusing, making it hard to follow their points.
        - **Intermediate**: The candidate communicates clearly most of the time but may occasionally be vague or need further elaboration.
        - **Advanced**: The candidate communicates with exceptional clarity and precision, making their points easily understood and persuasive.

        3. **Professionalism**:
        - **Beginner**: The candidate displays unprofessional behavior or responses, lacking in etiquette or respect.
        - **Intermediate**: The candidate demonstrates professional behavior generally but may have minor lapses in etiquette or tone.
        - **Advanced**: The candidate maintains a high level of professionalism throughout, exhibiting excellent etiquette and respect.

        4. **Alignment with negotiation best practices**:
        - **Beginner**: The candidate's actions and decisions do not align well with established negotiation best practices.
        - **Intermediate**: The candidate aligns with best practices in most areas but may miss some key aspects.
        - **Advanced**: The candidateâ€™s actions and decisions are consistently aligned with best practices, showing a thorough understanding and application.

        5. **Negotiation duration**:
        - **Beginner**: The negotiation was too brief, indicating that the candidate did not engage in sufficient negotiation.
        - **Intermediate**: The negotiation duration was appropriate but could benefit from more in-depth discussions.
        - **Advanced**: The negotiation duration was optimal, with the candidate engaging deeply and effectively.

        **Overall Qualitative Evaluation**: Based on the individual evaluations above, provide one overall qualitative evaluation for the candidate's negotiation skills (Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced).

        **Suggestions for Improvement**: Provide specific suggestions to help the candidate improve their negotiation skills, if applicable.
