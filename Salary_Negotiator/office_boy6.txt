Company batna for the role of  {'office_boy'} is  55000
Your move: Thank you for the offer of $30,500. I’m really excited about the opportunity to join as an Office Boy. However, based on my experience and the industry standards, I was hoping for a starting salary closer to $45,000. Is there any flexibility in the salary offer?                



HR: Thank you for sharing your concerns about the starting salary. I understand that $30,500 may not align with your expectations given your experience and industry standards.

Based on our initial discussion, I'd like to revisit the offer and consider a more competitive compensation package. While we can't meet your exact expectation of $45,000, I'm willing to make some adjustments to ensure you feel valued for your skills and expertise.

Let's aim for a salary that reflects your worth. How about we meet in the middle at $41,750? This offer still falls within our budget while acknowledging your valuable contributions.

Regarding benefits, I'd like to address your concerns by offering a comprehensive health insurance plan as part of our total compensation package. This will provide you with peace of mind and support for your well-being.

Additionally, we're happy to maintain the 10 paid vacation days initially offered. We believe this is a fair balance between work-life harmony and company needs.

Lastly, I'd like to discuss a modest signing bonus to sweeten the deal. How about $3,000? This will help you get settled into your new role and demonstrate our commitment to your success.

What are your thoughts on these revised terms?

I appreciate the adjustment and the inclusion of the comprehensive health insurance and signing bonus.The offer is a positive step forward, but I would still like to discuss the possibility of a slightly higher salary. Given my experience and the industry standards, would it be possible to increase the salary to $43,000? I believe this adjustment would better reflect my qualifications and align with my expectations while still fitting within your budget.I’m enthusiastic about the opportunity to join and contribute to the team. I look forward to your response and hope we can finalize the terms
