Let's begin the negotiation. Type your statements or offers.


Your move: My salary expectations are 35k and health insurance. Will i be able to get these?
HR: Thank you for sharing your expectations with us. I appreciate your transparency. Based on our initial offer of 34,000, I'm happy to accept your proposed salary of 35,000. We're willing to meet you halfway!

Regarding the health insurance, we do have an excellent plan available to our employees. However, it's a valuable benefit that comes with a small increase in premium cost. Would you like me to explain more about the plan and how it works?

Let's focus on the benefits package for now. We're offering 10 paid vacation days, which is above the industry standard. Are you satisfied with this aspect of our proposal?     
Your move: I will consider your offer if you will provide me with Health Insurance
HR: I understand your request to include health insurance in our package. I'd be happy to explain more about our plan and how it works. Our health insurance plan is designed to provide comprehensive coverage for our employees' medical needs.

However, as I mentioned earlier, the premium cost does increase with this benefit. Would you like me to walk you through a breakdown of the costs associated with this plan?     

Additionally, since we're already offering 10 paid vacation days, which is above industry standard, would you be willing to reconsider your salary expectation? We've already met halfway on the initial offer, and I believe our current package offers a great value.

Let's discuss whether we can find a sweet spot that works for both parties.
Your move: Yes i would like to listen to details
HR: Thank you for your willingness to listen to the details of our health insurance plan. As I mentioned earlier, our plan is designed to provide comprehensive coverage for medical needs. While it's a valuable benefit, the premium cost does increase with this addition.

In light of this, I'd like to revisit the salary discussion we had earlier. Considering you're open to considering our offer, would you be willing to meet us somewhere in between 34,000 and 35,000? We're willing to make some adjustments to ensure our package remains competitive and aligned with industry standards.

Additionally, I want to reiterate that our health insurance plan is an excellent perk, but we also need to consider the overall value proposition for both parties. Would you be open to a modest signing bonus of 3,000 to 4,000 to help offset any additional costs associated with the health insurance plan? This would bring your total compensation package more in line with our initial offer.

Let's see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both parties. What are your thoughts on this revised proposal?
Your move: I accept your offer

5. Accepted Salary: The accepted salary was 35,000, which is more than the user BATNA (30,000). Score 20 points.
